chatBTP ask -m 'Act as an assistant to write prompts for chatgpt models.
      I am trying to improve markdown documents. I would like to develop a prompt that makes chatgpt improve a given markdown document and responds only the raw markdown as improved version so that i can directly pipe the output into a markdown file.
      it is important that no other text is returned as the response should directly be used.
      Suggest a prompt that leads to this result'
