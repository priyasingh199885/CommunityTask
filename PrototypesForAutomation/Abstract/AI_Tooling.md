# Ecosystem: AI Engineering Tools

In this session Christian will show you what development looks like when you can use AI based development tools.
Currently those tools are usually not allowed for usage within SAP (e.g. [CoPilot](https://sap.stackenterprise.co/questions/3729)). But still it makes sense to learn and explore the capabilities these tools offer.

## Abstract

With the ever increasing capability of AI there are new tools available that can significantly improve the developer experience.

In this session we will show you how we enhanced SAP open source sflight CAP example using AI based commercial tools.
Currently those tools are not allowed for usage within SAP. But still makes sense to learn and explore the capabilities these tools offer.

- How to generate test data, enhance code and create tests with **GitHub CoPilot**
- How to get information on code security and code quality directly in the IDE with **Snyk Code**
- How to generate code documentation based on the code directly in the IDE with **Mintlify**
- The latest and greatest: Examples for coding with **GPT-4**
