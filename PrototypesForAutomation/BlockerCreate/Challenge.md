# Problems in Blocker Creation
1. Available SLots: A blocker longer than 2 hours overlapping 2 consecutive slots - session appointment for the next time slot marked as red(i.e., Parallel Non blocker)
2. Monday Blockers are counted, and there might be slots empty on tuesdays till friday, do we want to keep them open for booking?
3. Check if all the count of blockers occur at different time slot, and there are no 2 blockers at the same time. ex: 13th septmeber
