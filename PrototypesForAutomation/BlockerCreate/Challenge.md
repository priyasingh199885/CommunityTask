# Problems in Blocker Creation
1. Available SLots: A blocker longer than 2 hours overlapping 2 consecutive slots - session appointment for the next time slot marked as red(i.e., Parallel Non blocker)
2. Monday Blockers are counted, but cannot be scheduled from automation app
3. 1st of a month counted as 1st week of that month, What about days from last month occuring in same week as the 1st of the next month? To check logic for week distribution: ensure all days are counted and weeks are labelled as calendar weeks
