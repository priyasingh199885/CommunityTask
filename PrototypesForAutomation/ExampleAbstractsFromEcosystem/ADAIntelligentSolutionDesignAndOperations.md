# Ecosystem: ADA - collaboration-centric and AI-augmented solution design & operations

In this session Evgenii and Diana will show you how solution designing could look like when using ADA. 

## Abstract

ADA is an ArchOps Prototype that demonstrates collaboration-centric and AI-augmented approach to solution design and operations that aims to improve the engineering experience. It consists of two main components: Collaborative Diagramming and ADA Assistant.

During this session we will show you:

- how Collaborative Diagramming app can make solution design and infrastructure development more efficient, reliable and fun
- how ADA Assistant could augment Architects and Developers, while they are working on Solution Architecture and Infrastructure. We will also give you the examples of AI usecases and share our findings.

ADA was created by partnered teams Protopia_ and NVT FutureHub with support of Microsoft.
