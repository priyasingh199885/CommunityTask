# Ecosystem: A leap forward in AI? How are Chat GPT, Vall-E affecting us

In this session Christopher is going to talk about the impact of latest AI advances for the company and society


## Abstract

In the last weeks we have seen a huge hype on the capabilities of Chat-GPT. Lately machine learning models are becoming better very rapidly: they can write letters, modify videos and synthesize speech with an increasing quality.  With this advancement they are also becoming mainstream and people outside of IT jobs will get easy access to these capabilities.

This session looks at possible benefits, but also risks associated due to this development. Not going into the technical details, it should give some room for discussion. How will AI impact our daily work and the overall society. How can SAP make benefit out of it? 


## Speaker

Christopher Schildt is working as Security Architect for SAPs Healthcare products, being responsible for Data Security and Privacy of the products since several years.
