# Ecosystem: Architecture evaluations in agile environments

In this session Stefan Toth from embarc is going to talk about architecture evaluations.

## Abstract 

Architecture evaluations originate from the "classic" school of software architecture. To what extent do agile projects benefit from this practice? What is the state-of-the-practice and which methods are suited for agile environments? How does the well-known Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) fare in this regard? In this session I will provide answers, support them with practical experience and give tips for your own application.

## Speaker

Stefan Toth is co-founder of embarc GmbH and consultant for software architecture and organizational design. His main areas of interest are flexible architectures, architecture reviews, evolution of bigger systems and the connection of all these topics to the agile and lean movements.  He is author of many articles and of two books, including one on software architecture in agile contexts („Vorgehensmuster für Softwarearchitektur“, Carl Hanser).
