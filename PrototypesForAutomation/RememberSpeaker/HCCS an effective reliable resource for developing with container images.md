# Ecosystem: Hyperspace Central Container Service : an effective, reliable resource for developing with container images.

In this session Cedric DANGREMONT from SAP Security Testing Team is going to talk about the consumption of compliance information related to container images.


## Abstract

As a developer, you may already be using or considering containers as a way to build applications that are easy to scale, deploy and manage. There are many open source container images that could help you streamline your development process. But how can you do this efficiently, while still being sure you can comply with SAP policies (from security, to IP and export requirements)?
The Hyperspace Central Container Service (HCCS) provides a curated inventory of suitable, widely used container images. Or if you are already using containers, HCCS is a way to share your knowledge and experience with the wider SAP development community. In this session both HCCS marketplace and HCCS assessment tools will be presented and demoed.

## Speaker

Cedric DANGREMONT is part of the SAP Security Testing Team with more than 20 years of experience in IT and most especially in software development and software maintenance in various areas going from embedded automotive systems to ERP systems. Cedric currently acts as Product Owner for the HCCS project.
